# glycemic_variability_interactive

**Goal**: This interactive visualization aims to explore the relationship between gender, average blood sugar levels, and post-meal glucose fluctuations. We selected eight patients (four males and four females) with a diverse range of HbA1c levels, which measure average blood sugar over the past two to three months. Since a higher HbA1c level typically reflects poorer glycemic control, we hypothesize that patients with higher HbA1c levels may experience higher and more prolonged glucose spikes after meals. Moreover, we include an equal number of males and females to investigate whether hormonal or physiological differences might influence these glucose responses. Our primary goal was to make it easy for clinicians, researchers, or students to observe patterns in blood sugar responses around mealtime by various potential factors.

**Design Decision**: We chose a multi-line plot as it can effectively reveal trends over time and make it straightforward to compare multiple patients on a single shared axis. Each patient is assigned to a line with a gradient color transition by their HbA1c levels, where darker colors indicate higher HbA1c levels. Gender is specified in the legend as "M" or "F".  The x-axis shows the time elapsed before or after a meal (in minutes), with a dashed “00:00” line representing a fixed, preprocessed lunchtime. The y-axis shows glucose levels in mg/dL. An interactive tooltip is added so that exact glucose values can be viewed on hover, which helps prevent label clutter on the chart. The checkboxes next to legends allow viewers to select or deselect specific patients for comparison. Additionally, when multiple lines are selected, to make it easier for comparison, the "V-compare" toggle was introduced to display all the relevant information at a specific timestamp in a single tooltip.

**Alternative Choice**: Initially, we considered plotting additional line plots for each patient to show daily fluctuations in both glucose and skin temperature, as this could potentially reveal useful correlations between these variables. However, this might be more chaotic not only because of its inconsistent theme but also because it feels like a stack of nine static plots with minor animations between transitions. Even adding interactive tooltips to these lines would not allow viewers to effectively filter, gather, or transform the information they wish to explore. Thus, rather than replicating multiple plots in a sprawling design, we decided to focus on a compelling subset of data. This subset enables dynamic exploration through query filters on features such as gender and HbA1c levels, allowing users to draw diverse conclusions on their own.

**Development Process**: Since data is already collected, the most important part of this project is to clean and get the data we want. Since we decided to work with 8 datasets, each member of the team is responsible for cleaning 2 datasets. This part took up most of our time, because we hadn’t really decided which feature we wanted to add to our visualizations. Each member of the team took roughly 4-5 hours to clean their datasets and decide which features would be used in visualizations. MingRui Zhuang is responsible for plotting the data and adding style to the website and interaction, which took him a decent amount of time. ShiWei Yang and ZhenHan Hu are responsible for setting up the tooltips and V-compare interaction in the graph, ShiWei spent more time on debugging some of the mistakes. JingJun Ni is responsible for setting up the checkbox next to the legend, and along with ZhenHan Hu, they are also responsible for the write-up. The works are split evenly with great teamwork. Each person spent about 8-9 hours on this cleaning data and setting up the visualization, and spent about 2-3 hours to come up with the final thought.

# glycemic_variability_interactive

**Goal**: This interactive visualization aims to explore the relationship between gender, average blood sugar levels, and post-meal glucose fluctuations. We selected eight patients (four males and four females) with a diverse range of HbA1c levels, which measure average blood sugar over the past two to three months. Since a higher HbA1c level typically reflects poorer glycemic control, we hypothesize that patients with higher HbA1c levels may experience higher and more prolonged glucose spikes after meals. Moreover, we include an equal number of males and females to investigate whether hormonal or physiological differences might influence these glucose responses. Our primary goal was to make it easy for clinicians, researchers, or students to observe patterns in blood sugar responses around mealtime by various potential factors.

**Design Decision**: We chose a multi-line plot as it can effectively reveal trends over time and make it straightforward to compare multiple patients on a single shared axis. Each patient is assigned to a line with a gradient color transition by their HbA1c levels, where darker colors indicate higher HbA1c levels. Gender is specified in the legend as "M" or "F".  The x-axis shows the time elapsed before or after a meal (in minutes), with a dashed “00:00” line representing a fixed, preprocessed lunchtime. The y-axis shows glucose levels in mg/dL. An interactive tooltip is added so that exact glucose values can be viewed on hover, which helps prevent label clutter on the chart. The checkboxes next to legends allow viewers to select or deselect specific patients for comparison. Additionally, when multiple lines are selected, to make it easier for comparison, the "V-compare" toggle was introduced to display all the relevant information at a specific timestamp in a single tooltip.

**Alternative Choice**: Initially, we considered plotting additional line plots for each patient to show daily fluctuations in both glucose and skin temperature, as this could potentially reveal useful correlations between these variables. However, this might be more chaotic not only because of its inconsistent theme but also because it feels like a stack of nine static plots with minor animations between transitions. Even adding interactive tooltips to these lines would not allow viewers to effectively filter, gather, or transform the information they wish to explore. Thus, rather than replicating multiple plots in a sprawling design, we decided to focus on a compelling subset of data. This subset enables dynamic exploration through query filters on features such as gender and HbA1c levels, allowing users to draw diverse conclusions on their own.
